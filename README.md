# 5️⃣ Implement your feature
# ... write your code ...
# Build the feature according to ACs

# 6️⃣ Generate tests for your implementation
/generate-e2e-tests EPS-1234
→ Choose: Auto (use detected settings) or Manual (choose yourself)
→ Select platform: Web or Mobile React Native
→ Choose framework (Playwright/Maestro/etc.)
→ Generates tests based on your implementation + ACs
→ Follows spec-machine test patterns automatically

# 7️⃣ Run tests
npx playwright test                     # Web
# or
maestro test .maestro/EPS-1234.yaml     # React Native

# 8️⃣ Verify ACs
/verify-ac EPS-1234
→ Interactive verification
→ Test status tracking
→ Asks: "Post to JIRA?" → Auto-posts results

# 9️⃣ Create PR with full context
/create-pr  # spec-machine: Creates PR with JIRA link, labels, template
→ Links JIRA ticket automatically
→ Uses repo's PR template
→ Applies correct labels
→ Follows team conventions

# 🔟 (End of sprint) Track quality
/ac-quality-trends --sprint "Sprint 24"
→ See pass rates, velocity, issues
→ Developer leaderboard
→ Recommendations
```

### **JIRA Integration**

Posts formatted comments with:
- AC status (passed/failed/needs QA)
- Test results (E2E, API, unit)
- Code coverage metrics
- Test evidence
- Links to reports

Auto-updates ticket status and labels.

### **Quality Tracking**

Tracks across sprints:
