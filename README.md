## 🔄 Complete Workflow

```bash
# 1️⃣ Collect acceptance criteria
/collect-ac EPS-1234
→ Fetches ACs from JIRA + Confluence + Figma
→ Smart detection with confidence scoring
→ Creates AC checklist

# 2️⃣ (Optional) Add visual ACs from Figma
/figma-ac-extractor https://figma.com/design/xyz
→ Extracts user flows and interactions
→ Merges with existing ACs

# 3️⃣ Implement your feature
# ... write your code ...
# Build the feature according to ACs

# 4️⃣ Generate tests for your implementation
/generate-e2e-tests EPS-1234
→ Auto scans for selectors in your code
→ Asks which framework (Playwright, Cypress, Jest)
→ Generates tests based on your implementation + ACs

# 5️⃣ Run tests
npx playwright test
npm test

# 6️⃣ Verify ACs
/verify-ac EPS-1234
→ Interactive verification
→ Test status tracking
→ Asks: "Post to JIRA?" → Auto-posts results

# 7️⃣ Create PR
gh pr create

# 8️⃣ (End of sprint) Track quality
/ac-quality-trends --sprint "Sprint 24"
→ See pass rates, velocity, issues
→ Developer leaderboard
→ Recommendations
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### **Multi-Source AC Detection**

Automatically fetches ACs from:
- **JIRA** - Custom fields, description, sub-tasks, comments
- **Confluence** - Linked pages with smart parsing
- **Figma** - User flows, interactions, form behaviors

Smart parsing handles:
- BDD format (Given/When/Then)
- Bullet lists
- Numbered lists
- Tables
- Checkboxes

### **Framework Flexibility**

Generates tests for:
- **E2E:** Playwright, Cypress
- **Unit/Integration:** Jest, Vitest, Mocha
- **Component:** React Testing Library, Vue Test Utils
- **API:** Supertest, REST Assured
- **Performance:** Lighthouse
- **Accessibility:** Axe-core

### **Smart Selector Scanning**

Automatically scans for:
- `data-testid`
- `data-cy`
- `testID` (React Native)
- `aria-label`
- CSS classes (fallback)

Generates quality report with auto-fix suggestions.

### **JIRA Integration**

Posts formatted comments with:
- AC status (passed/failed/needs QA)
- Test results (E2E, API, unit)
- Code coverage metrics
- Test evidence
- Links to reports

Auto-updates ticket status and labels.

### **Quality Tracking**

Tracks across sprints:
- Pass rates
- Test coverage by type
- Time to verify
- Issue patterns
- Source quality
- Developer performance

## 💡 Examples

### Example 1: Simple Feature

```bash
/collect-ac EPS-5678
→ Found 3 ACs from JIRA

# Implement the feature
# ... write code to satisfy the ACs ...

/generate-e2e-tests EPS-5678
→ Scans your implementation
→ Select framework: 1 (Playwright)
→ Generated 3 E2E tests based on your code

# Run tests
npx playwright test

/verify-ac EPS-5678
→ All passed ✅
→ Post to JIRA? Yes
→ Posted to EPS-5678
```

### Example 2: Complex Flow with Figma

```bash
/collect-ac EPS-9012
→ Found 5 ACs from JIRA + Confluence

/figma-ac-extractor https://figma.com/design/abc123
→ Added 4 interaction ACs from Figma
→ Total: 9 ACs

# Implement the feature
# ... write code for all 9 ACs ...

/generate-e2e-tests EPS-9012
→ Scanned selectors: 87% coverage in your code
→ Generated 9 tests (Playwright + Jest)

# Run tests
npx playwright test

/verify-ac EPS-9012
