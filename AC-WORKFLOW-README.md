# AC Verification Workflow for Spec-Machine

> **Developer QA Workflow**: Ensure acceptance criteria are tested before PR merge

---

## 📖 Overview

This workflow adds three custom commands to spec-machine that enforce AC testing before pull requests:

1. **`/start-task`** - Initialize task with acceptance criteria
2. **`/generate-e2e-tests`** - Generate Playwright tests from ACs
3. **`/verify-ac`** - Verify AC testing status before PR

## 🎯 The Problem It Solves

**Before:**
- Developers merge PRs without testing all acceptance criteria
- QA finds issues that should have been caught earlier
- No systematic way to track AC testing status
- Manual AC verification is inconsistent

**After:**
- Every AC is explicitly verified before PR
- E2E tests are automatically generated from ACs
- Clear "Ready for PR?" gate based on AC status
- Audit trail of what was tested

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Spec-machine installed and configured
- (Optional) JIRA CLI for ticket fetching
- (Optional) Playwright for E2E tests

### Installation

The commands are located in:
```
/Users/mde/Documents/spectest/.claude/commands/
├── start-task/
│   └── start-task.md
├── verify-ac/
│   └── verify-ac.md
└── generate-e2e-tests/
    └── generate-e2e-tests.md
```

To use in your project, copy to your repo:
```bash
cp -r /Users/mde/Documents/spectest/.claude/commands/* your-repo/.claude/commands/
```

Or install via spec-machine config (add to `spec-machine.config.yml`):
```yaml
commands:
  - name: /start-task
    path: .claude/commands/start-task/start-task.md
  - name: /verify-ac
    path: .claude/commands/verify-ac/verify-ac.md
  - name: /generate-e2e-tests
    path: .claude/commands/generate-e2e-tests/generate-e2e-tests.md
```

## 📋 Complete Developer Workflow

### Scenario: Developer picks up ticket EPS-1234

```bash
# ========================================
# STEP 1: START TASK
# ========================================

/start-task EPS-1234

# What happens:
# - Fetches ticket from JIRA (or asks you to enter manually)
# - Extracts acceptance criteria
# - Creates .ac-verification/EPS-1234/ac-checklist.md
# - Shows summary of ACs

Output:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 Task Started: EPS-1234
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Acceptance Criteria: 3
  AC1: User receives verification email
  AC2: Code expires after 15 minutes
  AC3: Clear error messages shown

📝 Next Steps:
  1. Create branch: git checkout -b feature/EPS-1234
  2. Implement the feature
  3. Run: /generate-e2e-tests EPS-1234
  4. Verify: /verify-ac EPS-1234

✅ AC checklist saved to: .ac-verification/EPS-1234/


# ========================================
# STEP 2: CREATE BRANCH & CODE
# ========================================

git checkout -b feature/EPS-1234-email-verification

# ... Developer implements the feature ...
# ... Writes unit tests ...
# ... Tests manually ...


# ========================================
# STEP 3: GENERATE E2E TESTS (Optional)
# ========================================

/generate-e2e-tests EPS-1234

# What happens:
# - Scans your repo to understand tech stack
# - Analyzes your code for routes, components, selectors
# - Generates Playwright test for each AC
# - Creates tests/e2e/EPS-1234.spec.ts

Output:
📊 Repository Analysis:
- Framework: Next.js 14
- Language: TypeScript
- Testing: Playwright configured

🎭 E2E Tests Generated:
✅ tests/e2e/EPS-1234.spec.ts (3 tests)
   - AC #1: User receives verification email
   - AC #2: Code expires after 15 minutes
   - AC #3: Clear error messages shown

🚀 Run tests: npx playwright test


# ========================================
# STEP 4: RUN E2E TESTS
# ========================================

npx playwright test tests/e2e/EPS-1234.spec.ts

# Results:
# ✅ AC #1 test: PASSED
# ✅ AC #2 test: PASSED
# ✅ AC #3 test: PASSED


# ========================================
# STEP 5: VERIFY AC STATUS
# ========================================

/verify-ac EPS-1234

# Interactive Q&A for each AC:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
AC #1: User receives verification email
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What's the testing status?
1. ✅ Tested and PASSED
2. ❌ Tested and FAILED
3. 🔍 Needs QA testing
4. N/A Not applicable
5. ⏳ Will test later

Your choice: 1

# Repeat for AC #2, AC #3...

# Final output:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
EPS-1234 — Verification Report
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

┌─────┬────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────┐
│  #  │     Acceptance Criterion           │     Status     │

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always run `/start-task` first**
   - Establishes clear AC baseline
   - Creates tracking structure
   - No excuses for missing ACs

2. **Generate E2E tests AFTER coding**
   - More accurate selectors
   - Tests real implementation
   - Catches integration issues

3. **Be honest in `/verify-ac`**
   - Don't mark as "Passed" if untested
   - Use "Needs QA" for complex flows
   - Document issues found

4. **Link verification report in PR**
   - Shows you tested systematically
   - Helps reviewers understand coverage
   - Creates audit trail

5. **Run E2E tests in CI**
   - Add to GitHub Actions workflow
   - Prevents regressions
   - Validates on every push

### For Teams

1. **Make it mandatory**
   - Require verification report in PRs
   - Add to PR template checklist
   - Block merge without verification

2. **Integrate with JIRA**
   - Auto-fetch ACs from tickets
   - Post verification results back to JIRA
   - Link PR to ticket

3. **Track metrics**
   - How many ACs tested per sprint
   - Pass/fail rates
   - Time to verify

4. **Review generated tests**
   - Pair review E2E tests
   - Refine selectors
   - Add edge cases

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### JIRA Integration (Optional)

Install JIRA CLI:
```bash
brew install ankitpokhrel/jira-cli/jira-cli
jira init
```

Configure:
```bash
export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-token"
```

Commands will auto-fetch tickets.

### Playwright Setup (Optional)

Install Playwright:
```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

Generated tests will use your existing config.

---

## 📊 Example: Real Ticket

**Ticket:** EPS-1234 - Email Verification Flow

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. User receives verification email within 30 seconds
2. Verification code expires after 15 minutes
3. User can resend code max 3 times
4. Clear error messages for invalid/expired codes

**Developer Flow:**

```bash
# Start
/start-task EPS-1234

# Code the feature
# ... implement email service ...
# ... add expiration logic ...
# ... add rate limiting ...

# Generate tests
/generate-e2e-tests EPS-1234

# Run tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/EPS-1234.spec.ts
# ✅ All 4 tests passing

# Verify
/verify-ac EPS-1234
# Mark all as "Tested and PASSED"

# Create PR
gh pr create
# Link: .ac-verification/EPS-1234/verification-report.md
```

**Verification Report shows:**
- ✅ AC1: Email sent (tested with E2E + manual)
- ✅ AC2: Expiration works (tested with E2E)
- ✅ AC3: Rate limiting works (tested with unit tests)
- ✅ AC4: Error messages correct (tested with E2E)

**Result:** Clean PR with full AC coverage documented!

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No AC checklist found"

**Problem:** Trying to verify before creating checklist

**Solution:** Run `/start-task` first

### "JIRA CLI not found"

**Problem:** JIRA integration not configured

**Solution:** Enter ACs manually or install JIRA CLI

### "Generated tests failing"

**Problem:** Tests use wrong selectors or routes

**Solution:**
1. Review generated test file
2. Update selectors to match actual implementation
3. Run in debug mode: `npx playwright test --debug`

### "Can't create PR - verification failed"

**Problem:** Some ACs marked as "Tested and FAILED"

**Solution:**
1. Fix the failing functionality
2. Re-test
3. Run `/verify-ac` again
4. Update status to "Passed"
